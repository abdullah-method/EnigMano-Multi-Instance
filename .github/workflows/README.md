**EnigMano 🌀✋** is forged from two powerful concepts:

* **Enigma 🌀** — a puzzle wrapped in shadows, precision, and quiet strength.
* **Mano ✋** — the “hand” that commands, controls, and executes with unwavering resolve.

Together, **EnigMano** embodies *“The Hand of Mystery”* — a silent guardian orchestrating the life and legacy of every fortress instance with masterful precision and hidden grace. 🛡️

> **Project Focus:** This repository is part of the EnigMano ecosystem, dedicated to creating **RDP-enabled, fully automated Windows 10 instances**. Each instance is pre-configured, secure, and ready for remote deployment and operations.
